This is a Project focused on the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team and their offseason opportunities.
I pulled data from NBA.com for the top 4 teams in each division.
I pulled data from https://www.basketball-reference.com/contracts/players.html to find player's contract values.
Player value was determined by NetRTG against contract value.
